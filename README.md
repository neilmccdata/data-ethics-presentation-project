# data-ethics-presentation
first project at CodeClan focusing on data ethics and presentation skills.

The question I was asked to address was - "Are data breaches an inevitability? How do we minimise the risks?"
Every week we hear about yet another major data breach. Even with GDPR and increased privacy regulation it may not be possible to prevent a data breach. Perhaps we need to change our mindset, so that we start to think about when a data breach happens not if.

Weâ€™d like you to consider what organisations need to do to change their mindsets once they start to consider data breaches as an inevitability. Having changed their thinking, what controls would an organisation need to put in place to minimise the risks?

Presentation slides are shown in this data-ethic-presentation repo.
